            "She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;\n",
            "and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\n",
            "without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.\n",

            "away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,\n",
            "and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to\n",
